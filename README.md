# Mini Plague Simulation
Simple plague simulation on a directed graph.

- Population: N humans
- Each human has directed connections
- Infection spreads via outgoing and incoming edges
- Discrete tick-based simulation
- Written in C++ for quick modeling and completion

This project was intentionally kept small and simple.
